The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again."		"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC."
